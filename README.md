ex# Learning-Exercises
On Monday 29th, January 2018 I started learning to code for fun, using Javascript. Probably a lot of these exercises are going to be the ones from http://eloquentjavascript.net/

EDIT:
Around March I started to get more serious about coding, after seeing how I enjoyed it. I have begun Harvard's cs50 course though, so I will prob not be contributing in this branch in as much as I was expecting. 

EDIT II: On April 17th I came back to Eloquent Javascript after having finished all but two exercises in cs50. I have now learned how to use git from a terminal instead of using the GUI. My next milestone is finishing all the exercises in this book so I can be confident enough to colaborate in other projects written in Javascript.
As of now, I have learned some: C, Javascript, Python.
